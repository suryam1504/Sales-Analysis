# Sales Analysis

This project uses 12 months of sales data, which is then merged into one and made ready for analysis. This includes cleaning of data by removing NaN values, 
observing overall summary and statistics of the data, and doing all the pre-processing required to make sure that our raw data is ready to be used 
to gain meaninful insights. The analysis uses various libraries in Python namely pandas, matplotlib, numpy, etc. to carry out the data manipulation. 
This is followed by answering various corporate questions such as figuring out the best city and month of sales and the corresponding
earning, pre-eminent timings for displaying of advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying, products which were sold the most together, etc.
Data Visualization is also provided with every conclusion.
